# About

 social media feed web application that implements infinite scrolling and user authentication using Firebase (or Supabase/own backend). 

The application will focus on mobile and tablet support, ensuring that the web version mirrors the mobile experience for consistency. Users will be able to create posts that include text, images, and videos, and they will have the ability to share content with other applications. The project will also include user profiles that display essential information such as the user's bio, name, profile picture, and a section for their posts. The overall aim is to deliver a polished and engaging social media platform that prioritizes user interaction and ease of use.
